# carbonintensity

**Scenario 1:**

1. Get carbon intensity for each region
2. Gen intensity value forecast
3. Sort regions for highest to lowest intensity
4. Print sorted list in the logs starting with value followed by short name of the region
 

**Scenario 2:**

1. For each region get carbon intensity
2. Assert that generation mix sums to 100
 

**Scenario 3 (optional):**

1. For each region get carbon intensity
2. For each fuel type list five regions where the generation percentage is the highest
